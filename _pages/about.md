_Hey there!_

I'm a final year Mechatronic Engineering & Computer Science student and a part-time software developer.
I want to be a frontend engineer when I graduate - making things look great is my passion!
My hobbies include gardening, chilling out in my local park, and making awesome robots ðŸ¤˜ðŸš€
