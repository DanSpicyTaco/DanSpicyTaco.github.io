# Crypto building blocks

## Public Key Cryptography

## SHA

- SHA1 is faster than SHA512 --> only reason to why you would use it over SHA512

## Ciphers

- Block cipher - for large chunks of data
- Stream cipher - for data that comes in real time

* Understand how block ciphers work (CBC)

# Stream Ciphers and WLAN Security

- WEP sucked bc it was trying to KISS --> but you can eavesdrop in wireless networks
- Want to encrypt ICV
- IV was not encrypted and was small - could be repeated a lot
- CRC was used for integrity
