# Security

## Security in Distributed Systems

- _CIA principle_: provides guarantees a distributed system should have
- Security is about tradeoffs
  - E.g. having a $10,000 safe to protect $1000 --> not a good tradeoff
- _Security policy_: outlines security requirements and the tradeoffs you are willing to have

### Classes of Security Threats

- _Interception_: e.g. MITM attack
- _Interruption_: e.g. deleting file systems, DDOS, causing packets to drop
- _Modification_: e.g. changing files, code of a server, etc.
- _Fabrication_: e.g. injection, making new files and users
