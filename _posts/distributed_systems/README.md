# Distributed Systems

- [Distributed Systems](/src/distributed_systems/distributed_systems.md): Goals of distributed systems and algorithms

### Principles

- [System Architecture](/src/distributed_systems/architecture.md): Architectures used in distributed systems
- [Communication](/src/distributed_systems/communication.md): Types of communication used in distributed systems
- [Replication & Consistency](/src/distributed_systems/replication.md): Creating redundancy with replication
- [Synchronisation & Communication](/src/distributed_systems/synchronisation.md): Ensuring operations are completed in the right order, at the right time.
- [Naming](/src/distributed_systems/naming.md): How entities are referred to globally
- [Fault Tolerance](/src/distributed_systems/fault_tolerance.md): Preventing failures from crashing the entire system
- [Security](/src/distributed_systems/security.md): Security in distributed systems

### Paradigms
