I'm learning how to build Android apps for my thesis project.
The first step I'm taking is following the [DJI tutorial](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/application-development-workflow/workflow-integrate.html#android-studio-project-integration) in integrating Android apps with its SDK.
I came across something called Gradle - I have no idea what it is.
So I did some research!

## What is Gradle?

According to the [Gradle website](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html)...

## What is it used for in Android app development?

Build scripts and importing dependencies!
