One of my proudest achievements so far has been building and maintaining the website for MoneyLoop - a small startup that I worked at.
The founders put their trust in me to build a clean, responsive and accessible website for them.
Over 2019/2020, I've built 3 main versions of the website, all the while improving my web development skills.

## Version 1: Using jQuery

When I first started working at MoneyLoop (early 2019), I was tasked with creating a new website for them.
At this point in my life, I did not have a lot of web dev experience.
I spent about 2 months (part-time, 2/3 days a week) learning HTML, CSS and jQuery to create my first website.

I met with our designer every week to get feedback on the design of the website, which helped me understand basic accessibility principles.
Although I was proud of my work, I knew a lot could be improved.
For instance, this version of the website was not responsive (i.e. it was not mobile compatible).
Additionally, the spacing, margins, fonts and colours were not consistent between pages.

## Version 2: Using React

The next time I was able to work on the website was in January 2020.
I wanted to learn React, so I convinced by bosses to let me revamp the website using it.
The first thing I did was remove the carousel slider on the home page - I was never a fan of it!
I also used SASS variables to create consistency throughout the website.
Things like fonts, colours, spacing and margins all had variables attached to them, making consistency easy.
Furthermore, I made an effort to create responsive pages, resulting in a mobile compatible website.
I also used illustrations from [undraw](https://undraw.co/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create a more modern startup feel to the website.

Still, I thought some things could use improvement.
I felt that the website had a lot going on - pages with a lot of information did not have a clean way of breaking it up.

## Version 3: Adding fluid shapes and improving design

I started the most recent version of the website in April 2020.
Here, I focused on creating a consistent design.
Using tools like [Get Waves](https://getwaves.io/) and [Fancy Border Radius](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/), I created fluid shapes to separate information.
I really like the look of the fluid design, and I think it works well with the illustrations I had used.
Finally, I replaced all the button into a singular design (with variations in colour) - they had been inconsistent for a while and it was about time I changed them!

Ultimately, this website is one of the most fun projects I've worked on.
I've learnt a lot just from redesigning the website, and I hope I can keep improving my skills as time goes on!
