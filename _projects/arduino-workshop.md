In early 2019, I created a workshop on the Arduino, a popular microcontroller.
The aim for this workshop was to introduce university students to microcontrollers and sensors by getting them to build their own heart rate monitor.

The workshop is maintained and run by Engineering World Health (UNSW Chapter), and it has been one of our most popular and successful workshops.
Over **200 students** have been introduced to the Arduino this way.

The presentation, code and documentation for the workshop can be found in the [GitHub](https://github.com/DanSpicyTaco/arduino_workshop).
