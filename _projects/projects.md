I plan on adding a dedicated page to each of these projects (when time permits it).
For now, here's a list of my favourite projects:

- [Watchman](https://github.com/DanSpicyTaco/watchman): My thesis, basically securing drone communication with an encrypted channel.
- [Unicorn Pipeline](https://github.com/unicorn-ca/Unicorn-Pipeline): with help from solution architects at AWS, me and a couple of students created a CI/CD pipeline with a focus on continuos assurance.
  This allows you to deploy a Lambda application over multiple VPCs and run it against some common web application attacks.
- [My Ortho Journey](https://github.com/DanSpicyTaco/MyOrthoJounrey): A flask web application for doctors to manage patients undergoing Orthopaedic surgery. This came second for a hackathon in 2018.
- **MoneyLoop Analytics**: I created a page for MoneyLoop that processes our backend data and displays it in a user-friendly way. It utilised _datatables_ and _Chart.js_.
- **Sumobots**: robot competition that involved building a robot to battle other robots!
- **Robot Design**: we built an autonomous robot that could navigate through a maze - my favourite course of my degree!
